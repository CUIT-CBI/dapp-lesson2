# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

# Production Environment

> you can change the autoCreateDefaultAMM to obtain a store.if you use it to experience this process,i recommend you do this.

# Test Environment

> you can run test scripts to get the wholeness of this program.In this program,it exists huge loss of accuracy,but it is helpful to the AMM.This shortcoming will be  optimized by next version.
